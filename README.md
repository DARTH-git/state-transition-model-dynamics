# A multidimensional array representation of state-transition model dynamics
This GitHub repository provides the code of the method and exemplary cohort state-tranistion model (cSTM) explained in the following manuscript: 

- Krijkamp EM, Alarid-Escudero F, Enns EA, Pechlivanoglou P, Hunink MGM, Jalal HJ. A multidimensional array representation of state-transition model dynamics.

We recommend to first read the manuscript before using the code. The "Supplementary file_R code of the stylistic 3-state model.R" file has the same code included in the appendix of the paper, while the Markdown folder contains a more detailed description of the cSTM and the link between the code and the equations in the manuscript .
